The aneurysm sac measures up to 6.4 x 6.1 cm, \\npreviously 6.9 \\nx 6.3 cm (3:123).  The previously seen endoleak has resolved.  \\nStents in the \\nceliac axis, SMA, bilateral renal arteries appear patent with \\ngood distal \\nflow.  Renal enhancement is symmetric.  There is a large right \\nretroperitoneal \\nhematoma, difficult to measure due to its shape but involving an \\narea of at \\nleast 11.5 x 8.8 x 16.0 cm (TR x AP x CC; 3:150, 601:33).  No \\nactive \\nextravasation is seen in this region.  There is extensive \\nhyperdense stranding \\nwithin the peritoneum and extending into the presacral space \\ncompatible with \\nminimal intraperitoneal blood products and peritoneal reaction \\n(3:185).  In \\naddition, there is a pseudoaneurysm arising from the proximal \\nmost portion of \\nthe common femoral artery immediately after the origin of the \\ninferior \\nepigastric artery, which measures up to 9 x 9 mm arising from a \\n3 mm neck \\n(3:195, 192).

The gallbladder contains \\nlayering hyperdense \\nmaterial, consistent with vicarious excretion of IV contrast \\nfrom the time of \\nendovascular aneurysm repair. \\n  \\nPANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, \\nwithout evidence of \\nfocal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no \\nperipancreatic \\nstranding. \\n  \\nSPLEEN: There are multiple peripheral wedge-shaped areas of \\nhypoenhancement \\nsuggesting a splenic infarctions. \\n  \\nADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size \\nand shape. \\n  \\nURINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with \\nnormal nephrogram. \\nThere is no evidence of stones, suspicious focal renal lesions, \\nor \\nhydronephrosis.  Small hypodensities bilaterally too small to \\nfully \\ncharacterize but likely represent simple cysts.  There are no \\nurothelial \\nlesions in the kidneys or ureters. There is no perinephric \\nabnormality. \\n  \\nGASTROINTESTINAL: There is a small to moderate hiatal hernia.  A \\nfocal area of \\nhyperdense material within the stomach is consistent with \\ningested material.  \\nSmall bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness and \\nenhancement \\nthroughout. There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon without \\nevidence of \\ndiverticulitis. The appendix is normal.  There is no evidence of \\nmesenteric \\nlymphadenopathy. \\n  \\nRETROPERITONEUM: There is no evidence of retroperitoneal \\nlymphadenopathy.  As \\ndescribed above, there is extensive right retroperitoneal \\nhematoma with \\nextension of blood products into the pelvis.

Moderate right and small left pleural effusions. \\n\\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with past medical history of \\nabdominal aortic aneurysm status post EVAR with type Ia endoleak \\nwho was admitted to the ___ on \\n___. The patient was taken to the endovascular suite \\nand underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with physician \\nmodified fenestrated ___ which was complicated by \\nhypotension and abdominal pain in the PACU concerning for \\nhemorrhage.  The patient subsequently emergently returned to the \\noperating room for selective catheterization of the right renal \\nartery renal angiography and aortogram. For details of the \\nprocedures, please see the surgeon's operative notes.  She \\nreceived 4 units packed red blood cells 2 units fresh frozen \\nplasma and 1 unit platelets.  Following her second procedure she \\nhad an elevated lactate, and was given an additional 1 unit \\nfresh frozen plasma and 1 unit packed red blood cells.  \\nPostoperatively she was brought to the intensive care unit \\nsedated and intubated.  She was extubated on postoperative day \\n1.\\n\\nThe patient had stable hematocrits overnight.  However she was \\ndelirious overnight.  Her abdomen was tender on the right side \\ngreater than the left side.  She had evidence of peripheral \\nedema cardiology was consulted due to changes on EKG.  She was \\ncontinued on close hemodynamic monitoring, telemetry and was \\nkept in the ICU.\\n\\nOn ___ her mental status was improving, with diuresis \\nher respiratory status also improved.  She continued to have \\nvague abdominal discomfort and pain.  She remained \\nhemodynamically stable and was satting well on 2 L nasal \\ncannula.  She was continued on Lasix for diuresis, and a CT \\nangiogram of the torso was obtained due to a hematocrit drop.  \\nAdditionally EKG findings noted on the previous day corresponded \\nto a troponin increase 2.38.  The cardiology consult recommended \\nan echocardiogram suspecting a demand ischemia.\\n\\nOn ___ the patient was postoperative day 3.  She was given \\n1 unit of packed red blood cells and 20 mg of IV Lasix, she did \\nnot respond initially to this first unit of red cells and was \\ngiven a second unit of packed red blood cells.  Her hematocrit \\nthen increase to 24.3.  She underwent an echocardiogram revealed \\nmild global systolic dysfunction with coronary artery disease.\\n\\nOn postoperative day 4 patient was found to have a \\npseudoaneurysm of the right groin which was found on a bedside \\nduplex ultrasound.  She underwent thrombin injection of the \\npseudoaneurysm with good effect.  She underwent continued \\ndiuresis with IV Lasix and was started on high flow nasal \\ncannula for shortness of breath.  Her troponins plateaued from \\n0.37 - 0.38.  Cardiology consult recommended cardiac \\ncatheterization when the patient was stabilized.\\n\\nOn postoperative day 5 the patient was advanced to a regular \\ndiet, her troponins increased to 0.75 with a cardiology team \\nfelt they no longer need to be trended.  An additional duplex \\nultrasound of the groins showed no flow in the thrombin injected \\npseudoaneurysm.  The patient began working with physical therapy \\nand got out of bed to the chair.  She received additional 20 mg \\nof Lasix IV with good response.\\n\\nOn postoperative day 6 the patient underwent cardiac \\ncatheterization with cardiology revealing three-vessel disease.  \\nCardiology recommended cardiac surgery evaluation for CABG.  \\nCardiac surgery evaluated the patient and planned for an \\noutpatient follow-up to evaluate for CABG.  Patient continued to \\nreceive diuresis with Lasix IV.  Her Foley was removed and she \\nvoided spontaneously, her arterial line was removed.  A UA was \\nsent which was concerning for a urinary tract infection, and she \\nwas started on ciprofloxacin IV.\\n\\nPostoperative day 7 the patient was called out to the floor.  \\nHer urine culture grew out gram-negative rods she was continued \\non IV ciprofloxacin.  She had a oxygen requirement of 2 L nasal \\ncannula, however she was ambulating independently with \\nassistance from her nurse.\\n\\nOn postoperative day 8 the patient off of supplemental oxygen.  \\nShe completed her final day of IV ciprofloxacin for UTI.  She \\nwas given additional doses of p.o. and IV Lasix for continued \\ndiuresis.  Cardiology recommended the patient be discharged on \\n20 mg p.o. of Lasix daily, additionally we restarted her on \\nrosuvastatin 5 mg and recommended the patient have electrolyte \\nmonitoring 5 days following discharge.\\n\\nPrior to discharge she was able to tolerate a regular diet, get \\nout of bed and ambulate without assistance, void without issues, \\nand pain was controlled on oral medications alone.  She was \\ndeemed ready for discharge, and was given the appropriate \\ndischarge and follow-up instructions.  She was discharged home \\non 30 days of Plavix 75 mg daily.

He subsequently was seen to have aneurysm sac \\nexpansion, thought to be secondary to a type 2 endoleak and thus \\nunderwent coil embolization of his inferior mesenteric artery as \\nwell as several lumbar vessels.  Unfortunately, his sac \\ncontinued to expand.  It was thought that his graft was losing \\nproximal fixation and an additional cuff was placed proximally \\nas well. However, he still had persistent sac expansion and it \\nwas determined to be likely due to a type IA endoleak.
